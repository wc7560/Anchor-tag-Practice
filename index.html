        <p>I like YouTube beause it keeps me occupied when its raining and I have nothing to do. It also helps me study whenever I have a bad teacher how doesn't teach.<br><br>Amazon is a great website because it has everything you need. It allows you to find things more easily that if you were just surfing the web.<br><br>I only use the Instagram website whenever Im too lazy to get up and get my phone if its nt near me.<br><br> I love animeplanet because it allows me to watch anime ad free and without having to pay. It also has pirated anime movies in dub. <br><br>The IDBM page is only ever used if I wanna see a actor in a movie that looks familiar
